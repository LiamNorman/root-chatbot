There's a handy NPM package that integrates ngrok directly into you node app. https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok Alternatively you can download the ngrok binary from their website and start it with the command `ngrok http 3000`, where 3000 is your service port on your localhost. Once ngrok is started you'll see a URL that looks something like this `https://369e2a75.ngrok.io`, this is your public URL that you can now use to fulfill actions. Take a look at this tutorial for more how-to's on integration https://github.com/RichardOB/root-chatbot-webhook-nodejs#5-connecting-your-chat-bot-to-the-root-chatbot-webhook
